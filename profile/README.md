# Welcome to DownClim

**DownClim** is a project for regional and national climate projections downscaling including the mechanistic ‘dynamic’ downscaling of the CORDEX initiative. **DownClim** is opposed to the direct statistical downscaling of global climate projections found in WorldClim and CHELSA. The approach is justified by an improvement in regional projections of CORDEX compared to CMIP, although it can increase uncertainty and sometimes be less reliable. The tool is an automated snakemake workflow easily reproducible and scalable associated to conda environments for enhance reproducibility and portability.
